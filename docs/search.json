    "text": "Let’s start working in R! 🥳\n\n\n\nIntroduction to R\nR is a statistical programming language. Unlike more general-purpose languages, R is optimized for working with data and doing statistics. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (hence “R”) and was formally released by the R Core Group in 1997 (a group of 20-ish volunteers who are the only people who can change the base (built-in) functionality of R). If you want to build an independent, standalone graphical interface, or run a web server, R is probably not the ideal language to use (you might want C / Python or PHP / Python, respectively). If you want to vacuum up a bunch of data, fit several regression models, and then compare the models, R is a great option and will be faster than working in a more general-purpose language like C or base Python.\nIn general, R is…\n\nvector-based\n1 indexed (start counting 1, 2, 3, …)\na scripting language (R code does not have to be compiled before it is run)\n\nOne thing to know about R is that it is open-source. This means that no company owns R (like there is for SAS or Matlab) and that developers cannot charge for the use of their R software. This does not mean that all of your code needs to be public (you can keep your code private), but it is important to be a good open-source citizen by sharing your code publicly when possible (later we will learn about GitHub), contributing to public projects and packages, creating your own packages, and using R for ethical and respectful projects.\n\n📖 Suggested Reading: Basics of R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe History of R\n\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the history of R, here is an excellent article written by Roger Peng.\n\n\n\n\n💻 Useful Tutorial: R Programming Basics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming in R\n\n\n\nThis tutorial gives you an overview of the foundations that make up the R programming language, including:\n\nfunctions and their arguments\naccessing help files\nmaking code comments\nobject types (e.g., vectors, lists, )\ndata types (e.g., numeric, integer, double, character)\nR’s package system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to RStudio\n\n📖 Optional Reading: A tour of RStudio\n\nClick Here to download a “cheatsheet” (easy reference page) for navigating the RStudio IDE.\n\n\n\nNavigating RStudio\n\n\n\nThe RStudio window will look something like this.\n\n\n\n\nExploring the Panes\n\nTop-leftTop-rightBottom-leftBottom-right\n\n\nIncludes the text editor. This is where you’ll do most of your work.\n\nThe logo on the script file indicates the file type. When an R file is open, there are Run and Source buttons on the top which allow you to run selected lines of code (Run) or source (run) the entire file. Code line numbers are provided on the left (this is a handy way to see where in the code the errors occur), and you can see line:character numbers at the bottom left. At the bottom right, there is another indicator of what type of file Rstudio thinks this is.\n\n\nIn the top right, you’ll find the environment, history, and connections tabs. The environment tab shows you the objects available in R (variables, data files, etc.), the history tab shows you what code you’ve run recently, and the connections tab is useful for setting up database connections.\n\n\nOn the bottom left is the console. There are also other tabs to give you a terminal (command line) prompt, and a jobs tab to monitor progress of long-running jobs. In this class we’ll primarily use the console tab.\n\n\n\nOn the bottom right, there are a set of tabs:\n\nfiles (to give you an idea of where you are working, and what files are present),\n\n\n\nplots (which will be self-explanatory),\npackages (which extensions to R are installed and loaded),\n\n\n\nthe help tab (where documentation will show up), and\n\n\n\nthe viewer window, which is used for interactive graphics or previewing HTML documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Packages\n\n📽️ Recommended Video: Installing R Packages (4 minutes)\n\n\nInstall / Update the ggformula, mosaic, and tidyverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking on the R Server\n\n\n\nIf you are using the R Server (Cal ICOR Hub) these packages are already installed and do not need to be installed again.\n\n\nNow that you have the hang of working in RStudio, let’s install / update the packages we will use in the course. In this course, we will make heavy use of the tidyverse suite of packages.\nIf you have not used the tidyverse before, type the following into your console or use the drop down menu in the Packages tab (as seen in the video above):\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nIf you have used the tidyverse before, you only need to update packages.\nType the following into your console:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntidyverse_update()\n\nThen follow the instructions that print out to update a few of your tidyverse packages.\nIn addition, install the packages we used throughout our course.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggformula\", \"mosaic\"))",

    "text": "2 Exercise and Brain Size\nIn 2020, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that as many as 5.8 million Americans were living with Alzheimer’s. While there are several diseases that can cause dementia, Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia. There are many risk factors that contribute to dementia that can be controlled, like diet, exercise, smoking status & alcohol consumption. Yet other risk factors like genetics and aging can’t be controlled. Brain size typically starts to shrink in your 30s and 40s with an increase in shrinkage rate at age 60. Therefore, any intervention that can protect against brain shrinkage could help to protect the elderly against dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers in China recently investigated whether different kinds of exercise/activity might help to prevent brain shrinkage or perhaps even lead to an increase in brain volume (Mortimer et al., 2012).\nThe researchers randomly assigned elderly adult volunteers into four activity groups: tai chi, walking, social interaction, and no intervention. Except for the group with no intervention, each group met for about an hour three times a week for 40 weeks to participate in their assigned activity. Each participant had their brains imaged using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine brain volume before the study began and again at its end. The researchers measured the percentage change in brain volume in each participant’s brain during that time. If a person’s brain volume increased, then this percentage change was positive; if brain volume decreased, then this percentage change was negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Identify Variables and Types\nFor each variable, identify whether it is the explanatory or response variable in our analysis, and the type of variable.\nActivity:\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nCategorical - Ordinal\n\n\nCategorical - Nominal\n\n\nNumeric - Discrete\n\n\nNumeric - Continuous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in brain volume (%)\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nCategorical - Ordinal\n\n\nCategorical - Nominal\n\n\nNumeric - Discrete\n\n\nNumeric - Continuous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Identify the study type of this study.\nBe sure you are able to provide a full justification.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nObservational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis\nConduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

There are several possible reasons this could happen.\n\nConditions are Not Met: While not applicable to our situation, this could be a reason the ANOVA and Post-Hoc Tests do not match, especially if the constant variance condition is not met.\n\nUnder-powered Study Design: For all the comparisons we are doing we are actually using a ‘smaller’ significance level than the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) experimentwise error rate. Since decreasing the significance level also decreases the power, it is possible we do not have big enough group sizes to detect the effect size of interest in our study.\n\nUnbalanced Design: Tukey Tests in particular are sensitive to unbalanced designs, i.e. each group has a different number of replicates, which could explain the weak evidence again the null for only one group for our study, which is unbalanced.\n\nSo what is a statistician to do? There are post-hoc comparisons that might be better suited for this study than the Tukey HSD Test.

    "text": "2 Sex Bias in Professor Ratings\nSex bias stems from a perceived mismatch from an expected role or characteristics based on sex. Studies have shown that men and women have unconscious sex biases against women in traditionally male-dominated fields (such as the sciences) or characteristics (such as leadership qualities). These biases often cause equally qualified women to be seen as less likable or less qualified than the men. (These links are to descriptions of two well-known studies, but there are plenty of other good resources).\nResearchers are interested if this sex bias exists in traditionally female-dominated jobs as well, such as teaching. Students are asked to watch a video of an animated classroom and rate the professor. Each student is randomly assigned to either of two animations; the videos are exactly the same except for the sex of the professor drawn.

Notice that we use double equal signs == to indicate equivalence with a particular value, and since our variable is a categorical (character), we put the value in quotes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the summary statistics for each sample. Modify the code below to calculate the summary statistics for each group.\nHere are the necessary summary statistics for the Female professor video Ratings. We will save them for later use. To get them to both save and print, we can add parentheses around each statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Calculating a t-Test Statistic and p-Value\nNow that we have the necessary summary statistics saved, we can calculate both our test statistic (t) and our p-value. Recall the t-statistic for an independent two-sample test is\n\\[t_0 = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\\]\nRecall that we are looking at Female Ratings - Male Ratings. Fill in the blanks below using the saved object names (e.g. mean_f, var_m) from above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should get \\(se = 0.3185897\\) and \\(t = -3.508107\\).\nNow, calculate the p-value using the pt() function. Consider the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npt(t, df = n_f - 1)\npt(t, df = n_f - 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s calculate the test statistic and p-value using the t.test() function. Consider the direction of the alternative hypothesis. Recall you have three choices for the alternative.\n\n\"two.sided\"\n\n\"greater\"\n\n\"less\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.test(Rating ~ Sex, data = bias, mu = 0, alternative = \"less\")\nt.test(Rating ~ Sex, data = bias, mu = 0, alternative = \"less\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1 Switching the Direction of the Difference\nUltimately, it is up to the researcher to choose the direction of the calculated difference. If we wanted to switch our difference and have Male Ratings - Female Ratings, we would have to tell R to change the ordering of our variable using the mutate() function, since R defaults to reading our groups alphabetically and in the t.test() code would default to Female Ratings - Male Ratings (since F comes before M).\nHere is the code to reorder the variable levels so \"Male\" is read first:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, rerun the t.test() code, but using bias_reorder. What do you have to change to make the test equivalent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.test(Rating ~ Sex, data = bias_reorder, mu = 0, alternative = \"greater\")\nt.test(Rating ~ Sex, data = bias_reorder, mu = 0, alternative = \"greater\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Interpreting and Evaluating the p-Value\nUsing the calculate p-value from the t.test() function to answer the following questions.\n\nReorder to provide the appropriate interpretation of the p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a probability of\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nof t = -3.5081\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nthat there is no difference between the true mean ratings for male and female professor videos\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\n0.0004447\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nassuming the null hypothesis is true\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nof observing our test statistic\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nor less\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis, using a significance level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\)\n\n\n\n\nno evidence\n\n\nlittle evidence\n\n\nsome evidence\n\n\nmoderate evidence\n\n\nstrong evidence\n\n\nvery strong evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull Evaluation of Strength of Evidence\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember we have specific details to include in a full evaluation of the strength of evidence.\nWe have {very strong/strong/moderate/some/little} evidence against the null hypothesis (in favor of the alternative hypothesis) that {context of indicated hypothesis} (t = {xxx}, df = {xxx}, p-value = {xxx}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following statements are true based on the p-value?\n\n\n\n\nthere is a very small probability the null is true\n\n\nour data/test statistic is very unlikely to be observed if the null is true\n\n\nthere is a very small probability the alternative is true\n\n\nthere is a very large probability the alternative is true\n\n\nthere is a very small probability of finding evidence against the null\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.6 Calculating a Confidence Interval for the Difference of Two Means\nIn order to calculate the confidence interval for the difference of two population means, it takes on the same structure as a confidence interval for one population mean.\n\\[point \\ estimate \\pm (critical \\ value)*(standard\\ error)\\]\nor\n\\[\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2 \\ \\pm \\ t^*{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}\\]\nWe can find our \\(t^*\\) critical value the same way we found it for previous confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur point estimate is \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand finally we can calculate the lower bound (lb) and upper bound (ub) for our confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the “by-hand” method is tedious when we can just use t.test() to calculate our confidence interval. Fill in the blanks below to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.test(Rating ~ Sex, data = bias, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int\nt.test(Rating ~ Sex, data = bias, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide an interpretation of the confidence interval by reordering the phrases below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe are 95% confident that\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nthe difference between\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nBased on the sample\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nthe true mean rating of female professor videos\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nwithin the interval\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nthe true mean rating of male professor videos\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nis a single value\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nLB and UB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following would be plausible estimates for the difference between two true mean ratings?\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n-1\n\n\n1\n\n\n-1.5\n\n\n-0.5\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n-2\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we conclude about the study?\n\n\n\n\nwe can infer that the sex of the professor in the video causes ratings to be different for the videos\n\n\nwe cannot infer that the sex of the professor in the video causes ratings to be different for the videos\n\n\nthere is evidence the ratings for female professors are lower than for male professors in the videos\n\n\nthere is no evidence the ratings for female professors are lower than for male professors in the videos",

Honeybees perform an essential ecosystem service of pollinating crops in California and across the United States. Ecologists are concerned about the use of pesticides and the rise of colony collapse disorder.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) collects information about the number of honeybee colonies in the United States. Researchers at the USDA reached out to registered apiarists (bee keepers) in each state on a week that was selected by random number generation, starting in 2000. They record the total number of honeybee colonies reported in each selected week.\nThe dataset honey-bee-colonies-2020.csv has the data recorded in the variable Colonies, which records the number of honeybee colonies, in thousands.\nModify the function below to read in the dataset we will use in the example and store it as the object bee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint for Importing Data\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember to use read_csv() to import the data.

We want to graph the variable Colonies that occurs in the bee dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the x blank with the name of the variable. Fill in the mydata blank with the dataset object name.\n\n\ngf_histogram(~Colonies, data = bee)\ngf_histogram(~Colonies, data = bee)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat histogram is quite hard to read, so we can add some arguments to the basic code to help us visualize the data better. Recall you can use the following arguments:\n\nxlab = “___” : label the x-axis\n\nylab = “___” : label the y-axis\n\nboundary = ## : set the number where bins begin\n\ncolor = “___” : add an outline around the bins to see them better; fill in this blank with a color name\n\nbinwidth = ## : adjust the width of bins\n\nAdjust the arguments in the code chunk below until your graphic looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny multiple of the binwidth will work for the boundary entry, but 0 is the easiest to use most of the time. Your x-axis label should include the full variable, units, and the population. The y-axis could be labeled the frequency of the case, in context, if you like. In this scenario, that would be “Frequency of Weeks.” If you need to review the variables, population or case, review in the prior section.\n\n\ngf_histogram(~Colonies, data = bee,\n             xlab = \"Number of U.S. Honeybee Colonies (in thousands) in weeks since 2000 \", \n             ylab = \"Frequency\",\n             binwidth = 50, \n             boundary = 0, \n             color = \"black\")\ngf_histogram(~Colonies, data = bee,\n             xlab = \"Number of U.S. Honeybee Colonies (in thousands) in weeks since 2000 \", \n             ylab = \"Frequency\",\n             binwidth = 50, \n             boundary = 0, \n             color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Boxplot\nTo create a boxplot of a single numeric variable, we use the following structure:\n\ngf_boxplot(~ x, data = mydata)\n\nwhere x is the name of the variable you wish to graph that is stored in the dataset named mydata.\nRecall that we already loaded in our data on the prior page and named it bee. We want to graph the variable Colonies that occurs in the bee dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill in the x blank with the name of the variable. Fill in the mydata blank with the dataset object name. The function to make a boxplot is gf_boxplot.\n\n\ngf_boxplot(~Colonies, data = bee)\ngf_boxplot(~Colonies, data = bee)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe only need a little adjustment to the boxplot because it is based on statistics.

The t-critical value is calculated using the function qt() using this structure:\n\nqt(1 - alpha/2, df)\n\nThe first entry, is the area to the left of our critical value, if \\(1-\\alpha\\) is our confidence level. qt() will calculate the value of t (t-critical value) that binds that area to the left of it, given your degrees of freedom, \\(df = n-1\\).\nIf we are calculating a 95% confidence interval, then:\n\nthe confidence level \\(1-\\alpha\\) = 0.95, and thus\n\\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05.\n\nSince we know the sample size is 20, then:\n\nthe degrees of freedom (\\(df = n-1\\)) is 19\n\nThus, our code to get the critical value is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this value, we can use R to calculate the confidence intervals:\n\n2591.3 + 2.093024*(141.1066/sqrt(20))\n\n[1] 2657.34\n\n2591.3 - 2.093024*(141.1066/sqrt(20))\n\n[1] 2525.26\n\n\nWe can do the same calculation with saved objects, letting us be careful to (1) not round (as those initial outputs may be) and (2) not make a mistake typing values. All we need to do is set each part of our equation as an object value from its direct calculation. The objects xbar, s, n, and crit are made for you. Use those names together to calculate the confidence interval upper bound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could take the equation we solved manually and replace the values for the objects that store those value inside them.\n\n\nxbar + crit * (s / sqrt(n))\nxbar + crit * (s / sqrt(n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo finish our confidence interval calculations, we would run the same code but with a “-” instead of a “+” to calculate the lower bound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Calculating a single numeric confidence interval using t.test()\nIf we have raw data, then we can use the t.test() function to calculate a confidence interval.\nThe structure of the function is as follows:\n\nt.test(~x, data = mydata, conf.level = 1 - alpha)$conf.int\n\nwhere\n\nx is your variable of data for which you want to calculate a confidence interval\nmydata is the name of the dataframe object in R\n\n1-alpha is replaced by your confidence level, in proportions (e.g.: 0.95)\n\nThus, for our 95% confidence interval for our honeybee colony data (recall the variable is Colonies and the dataframe we stored it as is bee), the function would be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output supplies first the lower bound (2525.26), then the upper bound (2657.34) and displays your confidence level below again.\nEdit the code below to calculate a 99% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou could take the equation we solved manually and replace the values for the objects that store those value inside them.\n\n\nt.test(~Colonies, data = bee, conf.level = 0.99)$conf.int\nt.test(~Colonies, data = bee, conf.level = 0.99)$conf.int\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Arrange the words to interpret your confidence interval in the context of the question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween LB and UB\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nis a single value\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nBased on the sample\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nthe true mean number of bee colonies across all weeks in the US since 2000\n\n\n\n⇅\n\n\n\nwe are 95% confident that",

    "text": "Part 1: Introduction to Markdown\nMarkdown is a way to encode formatting on text in an unobtrusive way (compared to, say, html). Quarto documents use the Markdown language to code the text in the document, and allow you to embed code chunks that execute R code. Your finished .qmd document can be ‘rendered’ to other document types, and the markdown language converts to specific formatting.\nCheck out the markdown and rendered text side-by-side:\n\n\nWhen you do so, you will see this Markdown document converted to an HTML document and **this phrase is now bold**, *this phrase is italicized*, and `this phrase is written to denote R code`. To do the same in your own documents, you can use the same asterisks (*) or back ticks (`) as shown in the unrendered document. \n\n\nWhen you do so, you will see this Markdown document converted to an HTML document and this phrase is now bold, this phrase is italicized, and this phrase is written to denote R code. To do the same in your own documents, you can use the same asterisks (*) or back ticks (`) as shown in the unrendered document.\n\n\nWe are going to learn some of the basic Quarto editing techniques.\n\n1.0 Overview of Quarto\nBefore we continue, check out this Tutorial Hello Quarto (25 min). Remember, you will want to take notes as you move through the tutorials. You can also read more via this optional introduction to Quarto (30 min, all of Chapter 28).\nThe biggest thing to realize is that a Quarto document contains three types of content:\n\nA YAML header surrounded by ---s at the top.\nChunks of R code surrounded by ```{r} and ```.\nText mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.\n\nFor our class (STAT 250), you will generally only be editing the Chunks and the Text.\n\n\n1.1. Basic Markdown\nMarkdown can format a document just like you format your Word documents in other classes, but we’ll just cover some of the basics here. You’ve already learned italics, bold and code displays. Markdown can make lists as well, using a variety of encoding (see the online tutorial). You’ve probably also noticed that when you format your text, its color display changes, to help you see the formatting easier.\n\n\nUnrendered\n\n\nRendered\n\n\n\n\n*italics*  or _italics_\n\n\nitalics or italics\n\n\n\n\n**bold**\n\n\nbold\n\n\n\n\n`code`  \n\n\ncode\n\n\n\n\nsubscript~2~    \n\n\nsubscript2\n\n\n\n\nsuperscript^2^  \n\n\nsuperscript2\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Text block for answers\n\n\n\nText block for answers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Header Size 1\n\n\nHeader Size 1\n\n\n\n\n## Header Size 2\n\n\nHeader Size 2\n\n\n\n\n\n### Header Size 3\n\n\nHeader Size 3\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Comments Will Not Render: &lt;!--- this comment won't show up rendered ---&gt;\n\n\nMarkdown Comments Will Not Render: \n\n\nOne last thing of note - markdown works best with “space to breathe.” If you find that something isn’t rendering correctly, making sure there is a blank line between the text you are trying to format and the next helps.\n\n\nFor example:\n&gt; Although this is green unrendered, it doesn't appear with the formatting we want. Try adding an \"enter\" between the \"For example:\" and the start of this line and render again. Did it fix it?\nYou'll also notice that if there are no line breaks, this formatting doesn't end, so you don't need to put a \"&gt;\" before each line answer. \n\n\nFor example: &gt; Although this is green unrendered, it doesn’t appear with the formatting we want. Try adding an “enter” between the “For example:” and the start of this line and render again. Did it fix it? You’ll also notice that if there are no line breaks, this formatting doesn’t end, so you don’t need to put a “&gt;” before each line answer.\n\n\nNotice what happens when we add spacing:\n\n\nFor example:\n\n&gt; Although this is green unrendered, it doesn't appear with the formatting we want. Try adding an \"enter\" between the \"For example:\" and the start of this line and render again.

You’ll also notice that if there are no line breaks, this formatting doesn’t end, so you don’t need to put a “&gt;” before each line answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2. Creating Tables\nThe easiest way to make a table in markdown is using this format:\n\n\nUnrendered\n\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | \n|------:|:-----|---------|:------:| \n|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  | \n|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  | \n|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  | \n\n\nRendered\n\n\n\nRight\nLeft\nDefault\nCenter\n\n\n\n\n12\n12\n12\n12\n\n\n123\n123\n123\n123\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe : denotes where the cell values align; default is fine on labs. You might also notice that it doesn’t mater if my | don’t line up when we edit a table once we render:\n\n\nUnrendered\n\n| Right | Left | Default | Center | \n|------:|:-----|---------|:------:| \n|   12  |  124 |    12|    12  | \n|  123  |     123 |   123 |   123  | \n|    1  |  176 |     1   |     1  | \n\n\nRendered\n\n\n\nRight\nLeft\nDefault\nCenter\n\n\n\n\n12\n124\n12\n12\n\n\n123\n123\n123\n123\n\n\n1\n176\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nThat said, it is easier to read in the .qmd file if you add spaces and dashes as needed so that they all do line up.\n\n\n1.3. Mathematics\nWe often want to write small mathematics equations or write mathematical symbols. This is actually much easier in .qmd than in Word.\nWe surround an equation with $ signs: $e=mc^2$ which will appear as \\(e=mc^2\\) in the rendered document.\nHere are some examples of the type of mathematics you will use within your Quarto documents.\n\nGreek Letters\nWe often want to use statistical symbols within markdown to denote parameters with Greek letters. They are called by using a backslash (\\) and then the full name of the Greek letter, such as \\alpha, and surrounded by $ to be called within the equation-mode:\n\n\n$\\sigma$\n$\\alpha$\n$\\mu$\n$\\beta$\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(\\mu\\)\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\n\nSuperscripts and Subscripts\nWe can include sub- and superscripts to make our parameters and statistics specific. Note: once the equation is surrounded by $’s we don’t need the markdown edit for superscript like above. In math mode, you might see:\n\n\n$x^2$  \n$H_0$  \n$\\mu_1$  \n\n\n\\(x^2\\)\n\\(H_0\\)\n\\(\\mu_1\\)\n\n\nWe might want to make our subscript a longer phrase in statistics, to help denote our population of interest when we have more than one. We surround whatever we want to stay in a subscript with {}, such as:\n\n\n$\\mu_{female}$  \n$\\mu_{male}$ \n\n\n\\(\\mu_{female}\\)\n\\(\\mu_{male}\\)\n\n\n\n\nSymbols over Letters\nWe can call our special statistical symbols in a similar way, such as \\bar{x}. In this case, the bar symbol will be applied over the x, to make our statistical symbol for sample mean: \\(\\bar{x}\\).\n\n\n$\\bar{x}$  \n$\\hat{p}$  \n$\\hat{\\beta}_1$  \n\n\n\\(\\bar{x}\\)\n\\(\\hat{p}\\)\n\\(\\hat{\\beta}_1\\)\n\n\n\n\nEquations\nFinally, we can write little equations for our outputs:, like \\(\\bar{x} = 3.54\\).\n\n\n$\\bar{x} = 3.54$  \n$\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x$  \n\n\n\\(\\bar{x} = 3.54\\)\n\\(\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4. Code Chunks\nYou’ve learned how to insert code chunks using the shortcuts Ctrl-Alt-I (or Cmd-Alt-I), by clicking the green Insert +C button above, but you can also just type the two sets of code that surround code chunks, ```{r} and the ending ``` . Note, those are back-ticks, found above the tab key, not single quotation marks.\nWe can add labels #| label: to support easy navigation as well, but be careful, DO NOT REPEAT LABELS or this will cause an error when you render the .qmd file.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: simple-addition\n1 + 1\n```\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nAt the beginning of each Quarto document there should be a special code chunk called the setup chunk. This is where we read the packages used in the rest of the document. We often use #| include: false to as an option in the setup code chunk to hide the output in the rendered document.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(mosaic)\nlibrary(ggformula)\n```\n\nYou can also comment your code, which is a way of annotating it without affecting the code, using a # followed by text.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: print-answer\n42*42  #the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything, Squared\n```\n\n[1] 1764\n\n\n\n\n1.5 In-line code\nOne of the neat features in Quarto files is the ability to combine code chunks, text, and automatically include (or not– but we always will in this class) code and outputs in the finished document. We’ve been writing code in the code chunks, but you can also write it directly in line with the text using some specific formatting.\nLet’s demonstrate with our small study dataset. First, we need to read in the data as an object.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: read-study-data\nstudy &lt;- read_csv(\"study.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) #stops some extra output\n```\n\nThen we could calculate the mean:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: mean-wk1\nmean(~wk1, data = study)\n```\n\n[1] 1.142857\n\n\nBy running the code as above, we calculated the mean, but didn’t save it as an object – it just prints to screen and is forgotten by R. If we save the output as an object, we can use it within the Quarto file. When you save an output to an object name, it will not print the value to the screen unless you tell R to provide the value.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: mean-wk1-assigned\nmwk1 &lt;- mean(~wk1, data = study) # calculates mean and saves it as mwk1\nmwk1 # prints to screen the value saved to the object name\n```\n\n[1] 1.142857\n\n\nWe can use the named objects to display the value stored within it in-line with our text by using the format:r. We already know that paired back-ticks mark text to be printed out in code font. By including the r in the front, we tell it what follows is actual code to be run.\nFor example:\n\n\nThe mean number of hours studied in week 1 is `r mwk1` hours.\n\n\nThe mean number of hours studied in week 1 is 1.1428571 hours.\n\n\nUsing a stored object name is useful if you are going to use the value often (to cut down on typing), but if you only need to use the value small number of times, you can also write the code directly in line. For example:\n\n\nThe maximum number of hours studied in week two is `r max(~wk2, data = study)` hours\n\n\nthe maximum number of hours studied in week two is 5 hours\n\n\nNotice that we never ran that code in any code chunk. It was run and displayed completely in-line.\n\n\n1.6. Checking code & Rendering your Document\nYou can run specific code chunks to check their output by pressing the green play button to run the specific code chunk, or the icon next to it to run all code chunks prior to that code chunk.\n\nViewing Your Rendered Document\nIf you want to check your Markdown editing, you can render the document and view it in the ‘Viewer’ Pane by pressing the ‘Render’ button at the top of the Quarto document pane. Make sure the setting (gear icon above) is set to ‘Preview in Viewer pane’.\n\n\nChanging the Document Type\nYou can change the document type you knit to automatically by changing the output type in the YAML header from format: html to format: docx and press the ‘Render’ button. Your word document will be created in the project folder! (In this class, we will always use html documents; please don’t edit the YAML header of your labs; we showed you this simply for future information.)\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  error: false\n---  \n\n\nErrors in your Code\nIf there is an error in your file, it will not render. When .qmd files render, they run on a completely clean environment. So if you somehow loaded data or something else not with code in your .qmd file, the rendering process will create an error.\nIf you cannot figure out the error, you can generally still get your document to render by changing error: false to error: true in the YAML code at the top.\n---\ntitle: \"My report\"\nformat: html\nexecute:\n  echo: true\n  error: true\n---  \nThis will print out any errors in your code chunks, but still render the document.\n\n\nErrors in your Markdown\nThe most common errors in your markdown that can cause issues are deleting back ticks (`) around your code chunks or dashes (-) from around the YAML code, so always check that first.",

Try replacing sd() with other functions.\nRemember to add na.rm = TRUE if you get NA as an output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also some ways to generate multiple different statistics at once. Try the following two codes and note what information they provide.\nWhat information does df_stats provide?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat information does quantile() provide?",

While statistics used to be done by hand using long and sometimes complicated formulas, statistics are largely (and thankfully!) calculated by computers now and, more and more often, in fields in research, non-profits, government and industry, they are calculated using the program R.\nRecall your earlier reading “Why R?” to remember all the reasons we will be learning R in this course. You might feel intimidated at first using a program that takes code, rather than a series of drop-down menus, but we’ll walk through learning the basics of R so that when you leave the class you have a good grasp of R on which to continue building.",

    "section": "Part 3: R Coding",
    "text": "Part 3: R Coding\nR, at its most basic, can be thought of as the most powerful calculator you’ve ever had. R isn’t powerful just from its calculation ability, but its ability to utilize functions to apply complex mathematical operations to whole sets of data, which is what we’re going to learn.\nLet’s take a closer look at R commands. Complete the following primer: RStudio Primer: Programming Basics (25 min). (One additional note: the chapter gives some indication of the rules around object names, but doesn’t include one last rule: object names can’t have spaces!\n\n3.1 Loading Packages\nR comes with what is called a “Base” package, which contains numerous functions. There are tens of thousands of additional packages that contain even more packages for everything from 3-D visualizations to machine learning algorithms. To use functions from other packages you must first install the package\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"ggformula\", \"mosaic\", \"tidyverse\"))\n\nInstallation only needs to happen once. If you are using the CSUMB Cal ICOR Server then the above packages are already installed and do not need to be installed again.\nLoading packages must happen each session. We should always load our packages first thing. Go ahead and run the following code to load our needed packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2: R Syntax\nAs you covered in class, the R language has its own set of grammatical rules. The good news is that once you’ve learned the basic R structure, it is easy to apply to new commands.\nTo get R (or any software) to do anything, there are two important questions you must be able to answer: 1) What do you want R to do, and 2) What must R know to do that?\nThe answers to those questions can help us fill in the boxes of our generic formula template:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Generic Goal Template\n\n\nQ. What do you want R to do?\nA. goal\n\nThis determines the function to use.\nFunctions carry out commands from their inputs and create an output; in other words, we apply a function to its inputs to create the output.\nFor a plot, the function will describe what sorts of marks to draw (points, in our example). A function could also describe the type of calculation or descriptive statistic.\n\nQ. What must R know to do that?\nA. arguments\n\nThe inputs in R are called arguments.\nFor a plot or statistic calculation, we must identify the variables and the data frame that contains them.\n\nThe application of a function to arguments follows a simple structure: the name of a function is followed by a pair of parentheses. Values for the arguments are specified inside the parentheses. If there is more than one argument, the arguments are always separated by a comma.\nIn the generic function above, goal is the name of any function. The arguments (formula & mydata) identify the variables and dataframe that contains them. The ... indicates any additional arguments we many want to include.\nGenerally, functions are written as the name of the function followed by parentheses, e.g. log(). The empty parentheses are merely a reminder that the name refers to a function.\nSometimes, functions need more than one argument. R functions require the first argument supplied to them to be something specific, but then arguments can be added as needed – those additional arguments need to be named so that R knows exactly what you are trying to specify. Named arguments always have the form:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Generic Argument Syntax\n\n\nThose arguments are added as needed in place of the ... in our template (Fig 3). We can include as many arguments as needed as long as we separate each one with a comma.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Adding Arguments into Functions Syntax\n\n\n\nFormula Template\nThe formula argument in our template is where we define the variable of data to which we want to apply our goal. There are actually a few options for what that variable can look like, depending on the variables we wish to use. We use y to designate our y-axis variable, x to designate our x-axis variable (or in the second case, one single variable), and z to designate a conditioning variable that lets us create separate panels when we group data. The |z can also be applied to the single variable ~x.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Generic Goal Template\n\n\n\n\nAssembling the pieces\nNow we need to put together the pieces we’ve learned with our actual scenario. For example, we might keep a record of the number of hours spent studying on each day of the week during week 1 and during week 2 of the semester. We want to make a graphic of the hours spent studying on each day of the week. In this case, we have two variables: hours and day, so we’ll use the template:\n\n\n\nFigure 4: All Possible Generic Function Syntax\n\n\nSo let’s identify the pieces.\n\n\n\nbox\nfill in with\npurpose\n\n\n\n\ngoal\ngf_col\nplot bars of values\n\n\ny\nhours\ny-axis variable\n\n\nx\nday\nx-axis variable\n\n\nmydata\nstudy2\nname of the dataset\n\n\n\nWe need to fill in each piece into our template. So our code goal (y ~ x , data = mydata) becomes gf_col(hours ~ day, data = study2) and creates the following plot:\n\ngf_col(hours ~ day, data = study2, \n       ylab = \"Hours spent studying in week 1 and week 2\", \n       xlab = \"Day of the week\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning any new software can feel daunting, but referring back to this template and asking yourself the two questions – what do I want R to do? what must R know to do that? – will help you throughout your time working with R.\n\n\n\n3.3: Vectors, Objects, & Dataframes\nThe real power of R comes not from calculating values like a calculator, but in manipulating sets of data. Vectors are sets of data that are organized together. Groups of vectors that are associated are dataframes.\nFor example, we could load version of our data on hours spent studying in week 1 and week 2 that has three columns, one for day and one for each week.\n\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 3\n  day     wk1   wk2\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 M         1     2\n2 T         1     4\n3 W         2     5\n4 R         2     4\n5 F         0     0\n6 Sa        1     3\n7 Su        1     3\n\n\nTo be able to work with the dataframe in R, we need to read the csv file into R, using read_csv() which comes from the tidyverse package. We apply that function to the name of the csv file we wish to load, inside quotation marks. Go ahead and run the following code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError: could not find function \"read_csv\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get the error could not find function \"read_csv\" be sure you ran the code in Section 3.1.\n\n\n\nThat is okay, but that code alone means that R reads it and then immediately forgets it. If you tried this, your data wouldn’t appear in your “Environment” pane. We need R to remember and store the information in its active memory.\nWe can store information in R to use again later as an object. An object is a name given to a set of information in R. It can hold dataframes, vectors, numbers, or outputs from commands. To store information, we have to use an assignment operator, &lt;-. Anything on the right of the assignment operator is stored as the name on the left of the assignment operators.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Generic Stored Object and Assignment Syntax*\n\n\nNames of objects in R can be almost anything, as long as it doesn’t start with a number, doesn’t contain a mathematical operator (*, /, ^, etc.) and doesn’t contain a space. It is also good practice not to name objects the same as function names.\nThus, my code now becomes the following (run it and see what happens!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou won’t see the data, just some information about the data, but if you were to look at the Environment pane, a new object would have appeared in RStudio.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Environment Pane\n\n\nWe can look at all the data within these vectors again by typing the object name into the line of code without any other function. Doing so will print the dataframe to your screen as an output. Go ahead and run the code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we don’t want to see all the data, as there are hundreds of data points. We may just want to see the first few lines of data to get a feel for how it is entered. In that case, we can use the function head() to see the first 6 lines of cases:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur vectors are embedded within an object. To access them, we need to direct R first to the dataframe object, then to the variable object. We do so using one of two structures, depending on the function. We also need to know the names our variables are called. We can find out the names our variables are called by using the code names()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first you have already seen in our template – we identify the dataframe using an argument. We can then apply functions to specific variables within our dataframe, such as finding the mean number of hours studied in week 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor the total number of hours studied across week 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome functions don’t accept the data argument. In those cases, we identify the dataframe and variable using the structure: DATAFRAME$VARIABLE. We can then find the total number of rows in study using the function length()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that mean() and sum() calculated a single value across the vector. Other functions/operations are vectorized functions - they will apply to each element within the vector and return a vector as the output.\nFor example, if instead of the total number of hours studied across the week, we wanted to know the total number of hours studied on each day of the week, between weeks. We can’t use sum() because it collapses the information of the days of the week. We can instead add our vectors together:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will notice that the output of this is to return a vector. Each element of the vector was created by adding the same element of each variable. For example, the first value, 3, was obtained by adding the number of hours studied on Monday of week 1 (1) with the number of hours studied on Monday of week 2 (2), for a total of 3 hours studied on Monday across the two weeks.\nA few other useful functions can help us understand the dataset we loaded into R. ncol() lets us determine the number of variables in the dataset. nrow() lets us determine the number of rows (sometimes the same as cases) in the dataset.",

It can’t guess what you meant, nor add in a comma that you forgot to type. Read Chapter 6: Deciphering Common R Errors (5 min) which covers the most common errors in R and how to decipher them. R errors aren’t always clear to new users, but they almost always will direct you to where the problem occurs. Sometimes that is just telling you that it can’t find the file or object you are trying to point it to. Other times, it will repeat your code right up to the point where it didn’t understand. That helps focus your attention when searching for errors.",

With the rising cost of raw materials, it is more expensive to manufacture pennies than the coin is worth. Furthermore, as the US moves towards a more cashless society, the use of physical coins is declining, making the penny less necessary. On May 22, 2025, The U.S. Treasury Department announced it would end penny production starting in 2026. We are going to estimate the mean age of all circulating U.S. pennies. Rolls of pennies were collected from a bank in Marina, California in Spring 2020.

    "text": "2 Sex Bias in Professor Ratings\nSex bias stems from a perceived mismatch from an expected role or characteristics based on sex. Studies have shown that men and women have unconscious sex biases against women in traditionally male-dominated fields (such as the sciences) or characteristics (such as leadership qualities). These biases often cause equally qualified women to be seen as less likable or less qualified than the men. (These links are to descriptions of two well-known studies, but there are plenty of other good resources).\nResearchers are interested if this sex bias exists in traditionally female-dominated jobs as well, such as teaching. Students are asked to watch a video of an animated classroom and rate the professor. Each student is randomly assigned to either of two animations; the videos are exactly the same except for the sex of the professor drawn. You have been asked to analyze the data for the researchers to determine if the female-identifying professor is rated more poorly, on a 1 to 7 scale (with 7 being the best), than the male-identifying professor.\nRun the following code chunk to read in the data and view the variable names and first 6 rows of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Identify Key Components of the Scenario\n\nFor each variable, identify whether it is the explanatory or response variable in our analysis, and the type of variable.\n\nSex:\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nCategorical\n\n\nNumeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRating:\n\n\n\n\nExplanatory\n\n\nResponse\n\n\nCategorical\n\n\nNumeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the study design of this study.\nBe sure you are able to provide a full justification.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Two Sample\n\n\nMatched Pair Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the study type of this study.\nBe sure you are able to provide a full justification.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment\n\n\nObservational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nCalculate the summary statistics for each sample.

If we wanted to switch our difference and have Mother’s Age - Father’s Age we would have to tell R to change the ordering of inside each of our functions.\nRerun the t.test() code, but calcuate the differences between Mother’s Age and Father’s Age instead of the other way around. What do you have to change to make the test equivalent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt.test(~(MotherAge - FatherAge), data = parents, mu = 0, alternative = \"less\")\nt.test(~(MotherAge - FatherAge), data = parents, mu = 0, alternative = \"less\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5 Interpreting and Evaluating the p-Value\nUsing the calculate p-value from the t.test() function to answer the following questions.

    "text": "File Management\nAs boring as it sounds, file management is arguably one of the most important skills a data scientist should have. The reproducibility of a project depends just as much on the way in which the project was stored as the computing tools used. While using R and Quarto make an important step in creating a reproducible analysis, there are other pieces that are arguably just as important—such as file management.\nBelieve it or not, your computer has multiple locations** where files can be stored. There has been a bit of a generational shift as computers have evolved: the “file system” metaphor itself is outdated because no one uses physical files anymore.\n[This article]((https://futurism.com/the-byte/gen-z-kids-file-systems) makes the argument that with modern search capabilities, most people use their computers as a laundry hamper instead of as a nice, organized filing cabinet. However, the laundry hamper approach doesn’t play nicely with working in R and creating Quarto documents.\nA good programmer will store files according to the Project TIER protocol. More specifically, you will have:\n\na “Stat 250” folder in your Documents folder, containing all your materials associated with STAT 250\na sub-folder for each week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2)\nseparate folders within each week for each assignment (e.g., Practice Activity, Lab)",
